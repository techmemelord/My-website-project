      <h2>What is the Garfield Museum?</h2>
      <p>
        The <i>Garfield</i> Museum is a madeup museum in a website made for a
        school project. This was made by someone who loves <i>Garfield</i> and
        wanted to share their love for the comic strip with others. This website
        is not affiliated with Jim Davis or Paws, Inc. in any way or form.
      </p>
      <h2>What was the inspiration for this website?</h2>
      <p>
        Part of the inspiration for this website comes from the
        <i>Garfield</i> trail in Grant County, Indiana. The trail is a series of
        statues and murals that celebrate the comic strip and its creator, Jim
        Davis. The trail is located in Indiana in the towns of
        <mark>Fairmont</mark>, <mark>Muncie</mark>, <mark>Gas City</mark>,
        <mark>Marion</mark> and other small towns and cities. The trail is a fun
        way to explore the area and learn a bit more about <i>Garfield</i> and
        the comic's origins.
      </p>
      <h2>Why was this website made?</h2>
      <p>
        This website was used to imagine what a true <i>Garfield</i> muesum
        would be like and what it would have. Since there is no museums at all
        dedicating to <i>Garfield</i>, I took the opportunity to create one
        myself. This website is a fun way to explore the world of
        <i>Garfield</i> and learn more about the comic strip and its characters.
        <br />
        I hope you enjoy exploring the website and learning more about
        <i>Garfield</i>!
      </p>

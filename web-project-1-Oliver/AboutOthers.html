        Hello there! my name is Jon and welcome to my section about me!

      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p style="background-color: lightblue">
        I am the owner of Garfield and Odie. My profession is a cartoonist and I love my pets, no matter
        if they are rude to me or not. I am also a geek since I love polka music, doing anyting to prevent me from having to go shopping
        like using socks as napkins, and basically anything geeky, you name it, I have done it.
        <br />
        I also have a girfiend named Liz, who is a vet. She is the only one who can put up with Garfield's attitude. But besides all of
        these good things, my pets, especially Garfield, treats me like a <u>LITERAL SERVANT!</u>I am not joking when I am saying this. He makes me have to
        do everything for him, like getting his food, cleaning his litter box, and even replacing my drapes twice a day! But I guess
        that is what I signed up for when I got him as my pet. On the other hand, Odie is a good dog, but he is not the sharpest tool in the shed.
        He is not the smartest dog, but he is loyal and loving, so I guess that is what matters.
        <br>
        Well, I guess that is enough about me.

      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p style="background-color: tan">
        I am the dog of Jon and the best friend of Garfield (maybe not to him). I am not the smartest dog, but I am loyal and loving.
        I love to lick people's faces and I love to bark at anything that moves. I also love to chase my tail and I love to play fetch.
        Garfield has said <s>I am very smart</s>, actually, he said I am not that smart, I'll be honest, I don't even know what the answer to 2<sup>2</sup> is, but I don't care, I am happy being myself. But seriously Garfield always
        kicks me, attacks me, does literally <u>ANYTHING</u> to torment me just for his own amusement. He also says that I am a polluton machine emitting C0<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases just by
        breathing.
         But on rare ocassions, Garfield and I team up
        for certain objectives like playing for fun, finding our owner when we get lost, and even drving Jon crazy to the point where he ends up
        in a mental hospital! But other than that, Garfield is mean to me. But I guess that is what I signed up for when I got him as my pet when Jon
        Adopted me from Lyman who was my old owner before he moved away and left me with Jon.
        <br>
        But that is enough about me. Well, Bark Bark Bark.
